# Raspberry-Pi-Morse-Code

This is a project using the Raspberry Pi and an LED to display morse code.

The Raspberry Pi 3 Model B was used and the operating system used was Raspbian. 

A circuit was made on the breadboard using GPIO port 8, the LED, a resistor, GPIO port 6, and two M/F jumper wires. 

The morse code conventions used are from http://morsecode.scphillips.com/morse2.html
